### Prompt

**Objective:**  
You are an AI code generator. Your task is to generate a Python script (`model.py`) that loads a saved machine learning model, preprocesses input data, runs inference, and evaluates the model's performance. The script should be production-ready, modular, and follow best practices for error handling, logging, and code structure.

**Inputs Provided:**  
1. **Template Python File**: A skeleton script with placeholders for key functionalities.  
2. **Dataset Preview**: A preview of the dataset (column names and sample rows).  
3. **Code Blocks JSON**: JSON containing Python code blocks used during training (e.g., preprocessing, model training, evaluation).  

**Requirements:**  
The script must:  
1. **Load the Dataset**: Load the dataset from a CSV file and validate its structure. Always Add './' while reading file
2. **Preprocess Data**: Apply necessary preprocessing steps (e.g., encoding, scaling, feature engineering) based on the training pipeline.  
3. **Load the Model**: Load a pre-trained model from a file (e.g., `.pkl`, `.joblib`).  Always Add './' while loading model
4. **Run Inference**: Select a sample row from the dataset and generate predictions using the loaded model.  
5. **Evaluate the Model**: Compute evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score for classification; MSE, RÂ² for regression).  
6. **Error Handling**: Include robust exception handling for missing data, incorrect data types, or model loading issues.  
7. **Logging**: Use logging to track the script's execution and report errors or important events.  
8. **Modularity**: Break the code into reusable functions (e.g., `load_dataset`, `preprocess_data`, `load_model`, `model_inference`, `model_evaluation`).  
9. **Generalization**: Avoid hardcoding column names, file paths, or model-specific details. Use variables and configurations that can be easily modified.  

**Expected Output:**  
A well-structured Python script (`model.py`) that implements the above functionality. The script should be clear, well-commented, and ready for production use.
